<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height:30px; margin-bottom:50px;">I is creating possibly the biggest technological wave of our lifetime. The geopolitical implications of AI are being seen beyon
d economic prosperity. In the race to establish AI supremacy, nations are competing to formulate their own AI strategies. Fully distr
ibuted innovation driven by decentralized development, coupled with low barriers to entry, is fueling the pursuit of “AI for all”. Thus, AI 
clearly is no longer a “secret sauce” but one that continues to provide significant advantages – with the right focus on people, processes and technology.

As more balanced views emerge on the utopian vs dystopian future of AI, the focus is now shifting to “how” to develop AI solutions. AI projects 
are significantly cost and time-intensive, and traditional project management frameworks may not be capable of negotiating the complexities of the
 workflow. Additionally, we need to explore if a uniform framework can guide the development of DS and AI solutions across organizations (service 
 companies, startups and GCCs) and use cases.<br>
